## Installation

First, install jupyter, so the Python interpreter used by Cutter can find it:
```
pip install jupyter
```

Then, check the plugins path of Cutter by looking into Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins
and copy or symlink the subdirectory `cutter_jupyter` from this repository into the `plugins/python` subdirectory.
